# 🚀 Space Shooter Game – PyTorch AI Integration

A 2D space shooter game written in Python using the `turtle` module and integrated with PyTorch for real-time AI-assisted missile targeting. The game features autopilot mode, ally detection, and visual targeting cues.

🧠 AI Model
The game uses a simple PyTorch model to predict the optimal firing angle based on player and enemy coordinates. The model is trained with supervised learning to align toward the closest enemy.
